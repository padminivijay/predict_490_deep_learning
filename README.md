A place for Northwestern Predict 490 DL-Sec55 to share code.

Master branch should be considered the source of the truth. Code that is put in master branch works and is intended to be distributed amongst everyone.

To get work to master branch, clone the repository and create your own branch to do work in. When you have code that should get put into use by everyone, you can merge that specific piece of code back to the master branch. This will allow everyone to pull the master changes into their branches and continue working.

Rule of thumb: commit and sync often (push/pull code). This philosophy makes it easier to go back to points in time where code is not screwed up.
